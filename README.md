# CIS-81-3D-Graphics - Projects
First we'd read about topics and concepts in graphics programming, then we'd write programs from scratch, using the C++ library [FreeGLUT](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/). This was one of the harder classes I've taken.

Here's a video of my last two projects:

This video includes a vector-based drawing program. I made the entire from scratch, including its GUI.

The second part of the video shows a program I wrote that renders fractal trees on a randomly generated landscape.
