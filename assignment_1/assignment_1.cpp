/*
 * Notes -
 * One of the requirements of this assignment was to have lines near
 * eachother share vertices. In my solution, they don't. Instead,
 * when two lines should share vertices, a new point is created by passing
 * the other point's address to the new point's constructor.
 * This means they aren't literally sharing vertices, even if the vertices are
 * identical.
 *
 * Thus to draw a line with 3 or more points, I don't use the glBegin(GL_LINE_STRIP).
 * I don't know if this is bad - if so, I could work more and try a different solution.
 *
 * I tried to make lines actually share the same point() object by using shared pointers,
 * but I was getting segmentation faults after using the delete function. I was annoyed
 * because I thought using shared pointers would make it work. It didn't. 
 *
 * A different solution I would have used to tackle this entire assignment would be, rather
 * than tracking line objects, to make a vector of linked multi lists of points. It would 
 * be a linked list with forward iterators. If a point joins multiple lines points, that 
 * point would have multiple forward iterators. To draw this, a function would start at a 
 * point with only one link, and traverse the linked multilist in a loop until all forward
 * pointers were null. The function would pass point pairs (lines) into a container as it 
 * went, and at the end, that container would be used to draw the lines to the screen.
